# CB16A
This is an in-progress 16-bit CPU instruction set and emulator, written for a CS301 project.

## Current Known Issues
- Even though this claims to be 16-bit, it only supports 8-bit values.
- Labels aren't parsed and mapped to the appropriate addresses.
- There are no conditional jumps or a comparison operator.

## Presentation-Time Goals
- [ ] Resolve those issues
- [ ] Build a UI
- [ ] Port some of the early CS301 homework assignments

## Final Goals
- [ ] Complete the instruction set
- [ ] Write documentation
